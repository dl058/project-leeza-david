      <h2>About Us:</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Joe's Keyboards! We’re passionate about creating
        high-quality, innovative keyboards that elevate your typing and gaming
        experience. Founded in 2010, our mission is to blend cutting-edge
        technology with exceptional design to deliver keyboards that not only
        look stunning but also perform flawlessly. Our journey began with a
        simple idea: to craft keyboards that meet the needs of enthusiasts and
        professionals alike. What started as a small team of passionate
        designers and engineers has grown into a leading company in the keyboard
        industry. Our dedication to quality, functionality, and aesthetics has
        driven us to explore new frontiers in keyboard design. We believe that a
        keyboard should be more than just a tool—it should be an extension of
        your style and creativity. Our design philosophy combines sleek
        aesthetics with ergonomic functionality, ensuring that each keyboard not
        only looks great but also feels comfortable and enhances your
        productivity or gaming experience. Our keyboards are built with
        precision and care, using only the highest quality materials and
        components. From tactile mechanical switches to customizable
        backlighting, every element is engineered to provide durability,
        reliability, and performance. We put our keyboards through rigorous
        testing to ensure they meet the highest standards of excellence.
